Problem Statement: Develop a pseudocode solution to calculate and manage taxi payments, addressing confusion during the payment process.

Sub-Problems:

1. Calculate the total fare for a taxi ride.
2. Handle different payment methods.
3. Manage change calculation and provide a receipt.

Sub-Solution 1: Calculate the total fare for a taxi ride.

a) Define Variables:
- fare_per_km: Represents the fare charged per kilometer.
- distance_km: Represents the distance traveled by the taxi.
- total_fare: Represents the calculated total fare for the ride.

b) Control Structures:
- Conditional (if-else): To handle scenarios where the fare varies based on the distance traveled.

function
```
Define fare_per_km
Define distance_km
Set total_fare = fare_per_km * distance_km
```

Sub-Solution 2: Handle different payment methods.

a) Define Variables:
- payment_method: Represents the chosen payment method (e.g., cash, credit card, digital wallet).
- fare_paid: Represents the amount paid by the passenger.

b) Control Structures:
- Conditional (if-else or switch-case): To determine the specific payment method and adjust the payment process accordingly.

functions
```
Define payment_method
Define fare_paid
If payment_method is "cash" Then
    Collect fare_paid from the passenger
Else If payment_method is "credit card" Then
    Process credit card payment
Else If payment_method is "digital wallet" Then
    Process digital wallet payment
Else
    Display an error message for invalid payment method
End If
```

Sub-Solution 3: Manage change calculation and provide a receipt.

a) Define Variables:
- total_fare: Represents the calculated total fare.
- fare_paid: Represents the amount paid by the passenger.
- change: Represents the calculated change to be returned to the passenger.

b) Control Structures:
- Conditional (if-else): To calculate and handle the change based on the amount paid.

Pseudocode:
```
Define total_fare
Define fare_paid
Set change = fare_paid - total_fare
If change < 0 Then
    Display an error message indicating insufficient payment
Else
    Display the calculated change and provide a receipt
End If
```
